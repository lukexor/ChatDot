Chat Application

This chat application consists of a chat server and an indefinite number of chat
clients (users). The server accepts connections from the clients and delivers
all messages from each client to other clients or delivers messages from one
client to a specific client if a user wants. This is a tool to communicate with
other people over Internet in real time.

A client must communicate with the server and, simultaneously, it must be ready
to read messages from the standard input to be sent and accept messages from
other clients.

Users must log in first before they can communicate with the server or other
users. After they enter their accounts and passwords, the application will check
the validity of the information. If it is not valid, users will get the error
message that either the account doesn't exist or its password doesnâ€™t match. If
a new user wants to use this application, he/she must register first. Each
user's information, such as account and password, is stored by server. In
addition, the server should save all the records of chat for each user. If they
want, users can access their own records.

The server informs all online users when someone logs in or logs out. And when
a user logs in, he/she can see all online users with their names highlighted. If
a user wants to communicate with someone else, he/she just need to double click
the name. Otherwise, the message sent by the user can be seen by all other
online users.

The user interface is to be user-friendly.
